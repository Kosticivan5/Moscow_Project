      <p class="section__paragraph">
        Moscow, Russian Moskva, city, capital of Russia, located in the far
        western part of the country. Since it was first mentioned in the
        chronicles of 1147, Moscow has played a vital role in Russian
        history.Moscow is Russia’s heart. It is an upbeat, vibrant, and
        sometimes wearisome city.Long periods of occupation have extensively
        altered the natural setting of Moscow. The “cultural layer,” consisting
        of debris of buildings demolished long ago and of other materials
        deposited by humans, is up to 50 feet (15 metres) deep in some parts of
        central Moscow. Almost all the small rivers and streams that once flowed
        into the Moscow River through the city area have now been put into
        underground conduits or have been filled in.

      <h2 class="section__title">ARCHITECTURE</h2>
      <p class="section__paragraph">
        Moscow’s architecture is utterly eclectic. Medieval historical and
        architectural monuments are side by side with flamboyant buildings
        dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries and orderly 19th-century
        mansions emphasizing the regularity of parts. Those interested in the
        Soviet period can visit the celebrated Stalin’s high-rises and other
        Stalinist buildings. Interestingly, Moscow features three buildings
        included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, namely, the Moscow Kremlin
        and Red Square, the Church of the Ascension in Kolomenskoye and the
        Novodevichy Convent.
